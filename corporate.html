            </li>
            <li>We used the fonts ‘Gill Sans, Nova Heavy’ and ‘Auster Bold’ because they have a bold but clean look and are not too extra, which fits perfectly with our logo/brand because we want to make it a bit minimalistic. <br> This also fits perfectly with our target audience because we understood during the interviews that they find simple, aesthetic looks important (we also matched this with our marketing campaign). </li>
            <li>We used carousels on our website at the service page because it represents our app, and this makes it easier to access the second picture and it fits in the minimalistic look and feel which we want to represent. We decided to make the overall look minimalistic, youthful and playful to fit their preferences which we found out during the interviews. </li>
            <li>On our <a href="Home.html">'Home'</a> page you can find our logo, and vision we placed this on a different page so you can see what our vision is. This will be the first that visitors of website will see. This is because we find it very important to get our message clear and fast across <br>On the <a href="Brand.html">'Brand'</a> page we introduce our values. This will be the second page our visitors will see and they will be able to connect with our values and therefore our brand as well. <br> On the <a href="Services.html">'Services’</a> page you can find the app that we created. After being able to connect with our brand through our values, the visitor will get to know our app and get interested. <br> On the <a href="Team.html">'Team’</a> page the visitor will finally get to know the team behind all that they just saw.

          <ul>
            During the testing, we gave our participants four tasks. These tasks were to find our brand values, our team pictures, and our socials. The last thing we asked was to just scroll and look through our website. <br> <br> One issue we encountered while user testing was our corporate page. When scrolling down, the page kept jumping up to the top of the page. This was an issue we immediately fixed because we of course don’t want it to happen when our clients check our website. Since we noticed just one negative in comparison to several positive things when doing the testing, we put this in the first place as the most important.<br> <br>The second most important thing was that everything was found easily on the website, this was great because now we know how our clients would use our website in real life. Having a clear website is great for our clients. We want to make it as easy as possible for them to find what they are looking for on our website, and that is what we noticed while testing.<br> <br> Our participants all really liked the look of our website, especially the colours, and logo. Of course, it is important that our viewers find our website attractive when they search for our brand. However, this is the least important compared to our other points. <br> <br>When looking back, there has not been improved a lot on our website, except for the issue of the corporate page. Thankfully, this issue was resolved pretty quickly. Next to this improvement, there was not really anything we changed on our website.

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <ul>We decided to promote our brand on different social media platforms. After doing some research on our target group (student expats 18-26), we found out that they are really active on Instagram (+/- 29 min each day), TikTok (+/- 89 min each day), and YouTube (+/- 30 min each day). They have also a small attention span so short content is a must for them. With our campaign, we want to help and give advice on how and what is happening in the Netherlands with all the stuff that is going on. We want to give, tips on what to bring, fun facts and information about special occasions like strikes with this we hope to connect with the target group to help them in their lost and hopeless time while travelling. <br> <br> Our objective is that we want to reach 400 followers on Instagram, and a 50% watch rate on YouTube, and TikTok, we want to have at least 500 views per video before the 20th of May,2023. <br> <br> The media tactics that we want to follow for each media platform are: </ul>
		<img alt="Image Placeholder" class="img-thumbnail" src="images/Marketing/MediaTactics.png">
			
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <ul>The total number of accounts reached in the last 30 days is 107. 78 were not our followers, whereas 29 were. 17 of them interacted with us, and we gained 49 followers in all. <br> <br>Overall, our Instagram content has received 451 total impressions and 183 profile activities (this includes likes, profile visits, and so on). <br> <br>Our learning points from this media campaign that we have executed are:<br> <ul>
			<li>Start with posting on week 1. </li>
			<li>Follow our schedule. </li>
			<li>Start earlier by generating ideas for posts and not a week before </li>
          </ul> <br> We were very impressed by the number of people who interacted with us on social media, especially TikTok. We achieved our goals, which was unexpected. We learned a lot while executing this media campaign that we needed to reach the right type of content on the right platform since how the target group is active on their platform and how they want to be informed is crucial. We observe a difference between publishing a meme or a fun fact on Instagram and what we achieve with our regular postings; with the memes, we reach around 40 people and with the facts, we reach around 20, which is quite a difference.  <br> <br>We know from those figures that we need to utilize Instagram more professionally, which means publishing fun facts, information about us, information about the strikes, and other critical public transportation information. <br> <br>
           We averaged roughly 500 views for each post on TikTok, with only 4 followers and a total of 187 likes and +/- 45 likes for each post. We don't care about followers because we realize that people aren't always eager to follow and interact with new accounts; we're just glad that they enjoy the stuff we produce. <br> <br>The general conclusion from our content on social media platforms is that we want to use: <ul>
			<li>Instagram should be used in a more formal or enjoyable way, with fun facts and other critical information useful while travelling.</li>
			<li>TikTok for entertaining content that connects with our audience's emotions and challenges their attention span. The content could be a meme or another entertaining concept.</li>
			<li>All TikTok footage is reposted on YouTube, and we can use a trailer of this to host an event or advertise our product.</li>
          </ul> </ul>
			
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <ul>During the PRJ4 Brand Development course we had to develop a new brand based on personality and purpose. This included making a website, promoting our brand on social media, creating our own vision and values, making a lean canvas, and many other tasks. If this project would continue, we would keep on promoting our business on social media using the platforms Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. According to research, these are the social media platforms that our target audience uses the most. Promoting has gone really well and we have been gaining followers on a daily basis. By continuing this our reach will get even bigger, which is great for our brand. <br><br> During the campaign, we noticed that should have thought about what to post more, and what actually attracts our audience on social media. By making memes we were definitely on the right track, but I feel like we can create way more reach if we do more research on what our audience actually attracts. <br> <br>When looking back on the project it would have been better to start earlier. We started in the second week, which was too late. If we had started earlier, we would have been able to gain more followers and get a bigger reach on our social media. Starting in the second week also meant we had to come up with ideas for our social media in a shorter period of time. By making sure to schedule everything ahead of time the campaign would have gone smoother, especially at the start. </ul>
          <ul>Describe in detail your future recommendations if the campaign would be continued.</ul>
          <ul>Detail and describe clearly the process of what your would do differently based on you experience on this project related to the marketing assignment.</ul>
          <h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>
          <ul>Present and organize below all social media/online activities of the campaign. Context and material are according to the brand style, image, and vision. Images on the site are of high-quality, readable, and properly designed.</ul>

          <h2 id="management" class="mt-5">Management</h2>

          <h4 id="management-1" class="mt-2">Lean Canvas</h4>

          <img alt="Image Placeholder" class="img-thumbnail" src="images/lean canvas version one.png">
			<img alt="Image Placeholder" class="img-thumbnail" src="images/lean canvas version two.png">

          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
          <ul> At first, the team was adamant that the target audience it envisioned for the project was feeling hopeless while traveling through the public transportation system in the Netherlands. Another problem the team was very sure about was the language barrier that made it difficult to make the target audience understandable to the locals causing miscommunications. Lastly the team thought, as confirmed by preliminary interviews, that housing for students and expats in general has been quite a struggle.<br><br>Alas, as it can be seen by the second iteration of the lean canvas and from further interviews, it became clear that the language barrier was merely a focus of not being able to understand the announcements on the stations as they are not repeated in English. <br><br>Furthermore, it became known that confusion was a big part of the audience’s struggle as it is unclear where everything is (platform, etc.). Lastly, another problem came to light as the target audience expressed a need for further information on the strikes that happen frequently on the national Dutch railroads and with bus strikes. </ul>
			
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>As for the solution, it was thought that the team's service could have impacted the audience’s experience by providing personal help; providing help with their trip planning, and providing a tool to translate information. <br><br>After careful consideration, interviews, and brainstorming the solution changed in its purpose and it is now a service that would provide strike announcements with the possibility to translate or show in the audience’s own language what the announcement is.</ul>
			
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>The target that is the focus of the product and service are international students, aged 18 to 26, studying in the Netherlands, that are not exploring the Netherlands and love exploring. These of course are all distinguishable segments of the market our product and service caters to. The team also discovered, through interviews with representatives of the target audience, that another segment the product and service could and will branch out to is people that are careful with spending money, which also includes students.</ul>
			
          <p class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition</p>
          <ul>From the beginning, it was clear that the service and product the team would provide would be offered nationwide in the Netherlands but quickly the realization came that this wasn’t enough as a unique value proposition so the important announcements about the Dutch railway track (strikes/other important things) in other languages were added as it complements the concept, and it resembles the product and service as a unique selling point. </ul>
			
          <p class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage</p>
          <ul>The unfair advantage that the service and product have is that the team is closer to the target audience than other companies and this means that the team is more knowledgeable about the target audience as it works and studies with them on a daily/weekly basis. Later it also became clear that offering the service and product for free would compete with other services and products that charge a fee in the market. </ul>
			
          <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>
          <ul>List your main path to customers.
          As for the channels of marketing the service and product, nothing changed: all the options and platforms remain the same. The channels that the team is using and will use are: Instagram; YouTube; Website; TikTok and the Mobile app. </ul>
			
          <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>
          <ul>At first, the team wanted to use the calling function/service that was implemented in the concept as a metric to measure the brand experience’s success. After the service changed the metrics also changed and with that also the metrics changed: now it seems best to measure success by the amount of users and downloads the service and product has.</ul>
			
          <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
          <ul>In the beginning, the team had no idea of what the revenue streams would like except that there would be a prolonged partnership with NS, Bravo, etc., and that the service should have started as a crowdfunding to be started while also offering a monthly subscription of roughly 1€ or either 1€ for the purchase of the product indefinitely. At a later stage, it was decided that the prolonged partnership with NS, Bravo, etc. would remain as a revenue stream while changing to the freemium model (free service with space for advertisements on the product and service and also giving the option for either micro-transactions; or a monthly fee on a subscription base for the ad-free version of the product and service). </ul>
			
          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>
          <ul>As for cost structure, in the beginning the team only calculated their salary as a potential monthly cost of 32.256 € but later it was assessed that also there would be the costs of running the website and the mobile app together with the price of the facilities (roughly 132€ per m² monthly for an office space in the Netherlands) necessary to host the personnel that would be operating from those facilities (5.000€ a month for a web designer). Added to all these costs there would be the costs of administration to keep in mind that are coupled with the legal costs (starting from 899€ a month).  
          </ul>
			
          <p class="fw-bold">Services/products</p>
          <ul>
           The product and service the team is bringing into the market is a website that also translates into an app where international students can scroll through the different announcements in either English or their own language while also being able to reroute their public transport journey accordingly with tips and tricks. The above-mentioned product is the best fit for the brand as it provides the target audience with the opportunity to explore the Netherlands through a better experience of public transport while also connecting it to the culture and the experience in an improved system maintaining the sustainability that our brand values highly and making the public transport not only more accessible but also affordable as the product helps to reduce unwanted or unscheduled excess of financial expenditure.
